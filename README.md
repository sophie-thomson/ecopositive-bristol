### Design Process

***Wireframes***

- Initial Wireframe designs were used to plan out the layout for the Company List and Company Detail pages

***Models***

- The next step was to plan and devise an ERD for each of my database models and a schema to map out and understand the relationships between them. I created an ERD and model schema for the project based on all of the elements that I would like to include if I was able (this included the Should Have and Could Have User Story issues).
